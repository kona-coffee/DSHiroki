      <description>Living can sometimes feel quite difficult. There are so many things that need to be done, and amidst the pressure, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to rush, make mistakes, and end up having to redo everything. &amp;ldquo;Especially when busy, don&amp;rsquo;t rush. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to do things quickly, but don&amp;rsquo;t do them in haste.&amp;rdquo; Let&amp;rsquo;s take a moment to breathe, have a cup of tea, and proceed calmly.

      <description>Single Degree of Freedom Vibrational Motion Equation Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Hirokiüê∂, a data scientist.
A month has almost passed since the start of 2024. Time flies, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? Writing this blog allows me to forget about my busy days and express my own worldview, which is an important time for me.
Now, in my previous blog, I introduced the Matlab code for solving the single degree of freedom vibrational motion equation shown in the diagram below:</description>

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Hirokiüê∂, a data scientist. In my previous blog, I introduced the Matlab code to solve the single degree of freedom vibration motion equation. I have modified it a bit more to represent it in terms of inputs and outputs, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to solve it this way.
 First, this single degree of freedom vibration model. Normally, it can be written as a motion equation like this:
$$\begin{align*} m\ddot{x}+c\dot{x}+kx&amp;amp;=f \</description>

      <description>Single-Degree-of-Freedom Vibration Equation Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Hiroki üê∂, a data scientist. In my previous blog I introduced the Matlab code for the physical model, which actually uses a very fancy method called state-space representation.
Today, I want to delve a little deeper into this state-space representation.
So, in this post, I will introduce:
What is state-space representation? The benefits of representing a single-degree-of-freedom vibration model in state-space representation    Firstly, this is the single-degree-of-freedom vibration model.</description>

      <description>spectrum analysis for stock data Hello this is data scientist Hiroki.
Don&amp;rsquo;t you have some trouble for future analysis of stock time data, and do you want to use the basic mathmatics for it? I also have some trouble especially when I read the technical analysis books of stock time data. I wanted to use the besic mathmatics theory for the stock time data analysis. so I decided to write this blog.</description>
