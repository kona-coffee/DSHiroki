      <description>Single Degree of Freedom Vibrational Motion Equation Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Hirokiüê∂, a data scientist.
A month has almost passed since the start of 2024. Time flies, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? Writing this blog allows me to forget about my busy days and express my own worldview, which is an important time for me.
Now, in my previous blog, I introduced the Matlab code for solving the single degree of freedom vibrational motion equation shown in the diagram below:</description>

      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Hirokiüê∂, a data scientist. In my previous blog, I introduced the Matlab code to solve the single degree of freedom vibration motion equation. I have modified it a bit more to represent it in terms of inputs and outputs, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to solve it this way.
 First, this single degree of freedom vibration model. Normally, it can be written as a motion equation like this:
$$\begin{align*} m\ddot{x}+c\dot{x}+kx&amp;amp;=f \</description>

      <description>Single-Degree-of-Freedom Vibration Equation Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Hiroki üê∂, a data scientist. In my previous blog I introduced the Matlab code for the physical model, which actually uses a very fancy method called state-space representation.
Today, I want to delve a little deeper into this state-space representation.
So, in this post, I will introduce:
What is state-space representation? The benefits of representing a single-degree-of-freedom vibration model in state-space representation    Firstly, this is the single-degree-of-freedom vibration model.</description>

      <description>Programming Physical Modeling with ChatGPT A must-see for a student in science! Expand your learning horizons with this super convenient way to use ChatGPT!
Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Hiroki üê∂, a data scientist.
There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of buzz recently about ChatGPT gaining new capabilities!
For example, check out this YouTube video.
  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to apply this!
For instance, a fundamental model taught in the first year of engineering studies is the single-degree-of-freedom vibration model.</description>
